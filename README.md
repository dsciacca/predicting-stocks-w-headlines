# Predicting Dow Jones Industrial Average Ups and Downs with Daily Top News Headlines
MSDS-696 - Data Science Practicum II - Final Project

## Indroduction
In this project, I have attempted to create a stock market performance prediction model using news headlines to assist with better investment performance. News reports can have a profound impact on stock market performance (Beers, 2019), but the problem is that there are so many news articles published every day that itâ€™s nearly impossible for an individual person to be aware of everything going on in the news at any given moment, much less quantify the impact of each article on stock market performance. This project aims to address this issue by using natural language processing (NLP) and clustering on historic news headlines and stock performance from each day to better understand how the news can impact the stock market and, more importantly, assess how these news headlines can be used to predict whether the stock market will rise or fall that day and/or in the near future.  

## The Data
For this project, I used Kaggle datasets that include the top 25 daily news headlines from June 8, 2008 to July 1, 2016 and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) stock performance data during this same time period (Aaron7sun, 2016). This dataset contains nearly 2000 rows and 33 columns overall and is easily downloadable from Kaggle.
